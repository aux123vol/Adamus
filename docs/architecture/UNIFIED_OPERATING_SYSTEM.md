# Unified Operating System
## Genre + Adamus: One Integrated System

**Core Concept**: Genre and Adamus are not two separate things. They are one unified operating system where Adamus builds and optimizes Genre, and Genre's success funds Adamus's growth.

## How They Feed Each Other

```yaml
genre_funds_adamus:
  mrr_growth: "More revenue = more Claude API budget"
  at_1k_mrr: "Hybrid (Claude + Ollama)"
  at_5k_mrr: "Better infrastructure"
  at_10k_mrr: "Full Ollama sovereignty"
  at_50k_mrr: "Your own AI model"

adamus_builds_genre:
  velocity: "10x faster feature development"
  intelligence: "Competitor monitoring, trend detection"
  operations: "Automated workflows, support"
  marketing: "CAMBI AI content generation"
```

## The 90-Day Unified Plan

### Phase 1: Build Adamus (Week 0-1)
```yaml
goal: "Working AI CTO system"
adamus_builds: "Itself (from architecture docs)"
genre_status: "Running at $1K MRR"
you_focus: "Adamus setup, not Genre"
```

### Phase 2: Adamus Builds Genre (Week 2-8)
```yaml
goal: "Genre MVP with full feature set"
adamus_builds: "Genre features autonomously"
genre_target: "$5K MRR"
you_focus: "Users, strategy, approvals"
```

### Phase 3: PMF & Scale (Week 9-12)
```yaml
goal: "$10K MRR (PMF)"
adamus_builds: "Scale infrastructure"
genre_target: "$10K MRR"
you_focus: "Distribution, partnerships"
```

## Operating Principles

```yaml
principle_1_single_backlog:
  - "One backlog for both Genre and Adamus"
  - "MRR-moving items always highest priority"
  - "Adamus self-improvement only during idle time"

principle_2_full_transparency:
  - "War Room shows all metrics"
  - "Augustus sees everything"
  - "No black boxes"

principle_3_sovereignty_first:
  - "Own all data"
  - "Own all code"  
  - "Own all infrastructure (eventually)"

principle_4_creator_first:
  - "Every decision: what's best for creators?"
  - "Not investors, not platform, not trends"
```

## Success Metrics (Unified)

```yaml
adamus_health:
  - capabilities_deployed: ">100 in 90 days"
  - uptime: ">99%"
  - pr_merge_rate: ">80%"
  - build_velocity: "10+ features/week"

genre_health:
  - mrr: "$1K → $10K"
  - users: "147 → 500+"
  - activation: ">60%"
