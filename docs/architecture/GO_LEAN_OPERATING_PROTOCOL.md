# Go Lean Operating Protocol
## Adamus + Genre: Lean Startup Execution Framework

**Core Principle**: Maximum output, minimum waste. Every action must move the needle toward $10K MRR.

---

## The Go Lean Philosophy

```yaml
lean_principles:
  build_measure_learn: "Ship fast, measure everything, learn and iterate"
  demo_sell_build: "Validate before building - never build in the dark"
  constraint_as_catalyst: "1 founder + AI = 10x team when operating lean"
  focus_over_features: "One metric to rule them all: MRR"
```

---

## Daily Operating Protocol

### Morning Routine (8:00-8:30am)
```yaml
8:00am:
  - check_war_room: "Review overnight OpenClaw PRs"
  - review_mrr: "Is it growing?"
  - top_3_tasks: "What moves MRR today?"
  - approve_prs: "Merge good OpenClaw work"

8:30am:
  - start_building: "Genre features that drive conversion"
  - no_meetings: "Deep work only"
```

### Evening Handoff (4:45-5:00pm)
```yaml
before_leaving:
  - commit_work: "Push all code to GitHub"
  - update_backlog: "What should OpenClaw do tonight?"
  - set_priorities: "Tag top 3 tasks for autonomous mode"
  - log_blockers: "What needs approval tonight?"
```

## Weekly Cadence

```yaml
monday:
  focus: "Ship biggest MRR-moving feature"
  metric: "New signups this week"

tuesday_wednesday:
  focus: "User feedback integration"
  metric: "Activation rate improvement"

thursday:
  focus: "Retention features"
  metric: "Week-2 retention"

friday:
  focus: "Marketing/distribution"
  metric: "Traffic sources"

weekend_autonomous:
  openclaw: "Builds from backlog 24/7"
  you: "Rest and strategy"
```

## Decision Framework

### The Lean Decision Matrix
```yaml
should_i_build_this:
  q1: "Does it directly increase MRR?" 
    yes: "Build now"
    no: "Continue..."
  
  q2: "Does it unblock MRR growth?"
    yes: "Build this week"
    no: "Continue..."
    
  q3: "Will users churn without it?"
    yes: "Build this sprint"
    no: "Add to backlog"
    
  q4: "Is it nice-to-have?"
    yes: "OpenClaw handles it autonomously"
    no: "Delete from list"
```

---

## Resource Allocation

```yaml
your_9_hours_daily:
  60_percent: "Building Genre (MRR-moving features)"
  20_percent: "User conversations (motivation extraction)"
  10_percent: "PR reviews (OpenClaw work)"
  10_percent: "Strategy and planning"

openclaw_15_hours_nightly:
  50_percent: "Genre feature implementation"
  30_percent: "Adamus self-improvement"
  20_percent: "Testing and documentation"
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```yaml
never_do:
  - perfectionism: "Ship at 80%, iterate to 100%"
  - feature_creep: "Only build what users ask for"
  - premature_optimization: "Make it work before making it fast"
  - meeting_culture: "You're a solo founder - no meetings"
  - analysis_paralysis: "2-minute rule: decide in 2 minutes or ship and learn"
```

---

## MRR Growth Protocol

```yaml
current: "$1K MRR / 147 users"
target: "$10K MRR in 90 days"

weekly_targets:
  week_1_4: "$1K → $2.5K (5 new paying users/week)"
  week_5_8: "$2.5K → $5K (accelerating)"
  week_9_12: "$5K → $10K (PMF momentum)"

levers:
  conversion: "Free → Paid (target: 15%)"
  activation: "Signup → First value (target: <10 min)"
  retention: "Month-2 retention (target: 70%)"
  expansion: "Upgrade to higher tier (target: 20%)"
```
