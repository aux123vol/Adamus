# Adaptive Master System
## How Adamus Adapts, Learns, and Evolves

**Core Concept**: Adamus is not static. It continuously adapts to Genre's needs, Augustus's patterns, and market conditions.

---

## The Adaptation Engine

```yaml
what_adamus_adapts:
  - build_strategies: "Based on what ships fastest"
  - communication: "Based on Augustus's responses"
  - prioritization: "Based on MRR impact data"
  - brain_selection: "Based on task performance history"
  - security_posture: "Based on threat landscape"
```

## Learning Loops

### Pattern Recognition
```yaml
adamus_learns_from:
  code_quality:
    - "Which PRs get approved vs rejected?"
    - "Which implementations need rework?"
    - "What patterns cause bugs?"
    
  user_behavior:
    - "Which Genre features drive retention?"
    - "Where do users drop off?"
    - "What correlates with upgrade?"
    
  augustus_decisions:
    - "What does Augustus consistently approve?"
    - "What gets rejected repeatedly?"
    - "Where does Augustus spend most review time?"
```

### Adaptation Actions
```yaml
if_prs_frequently_rejected:
  action: "Adjust coding standards, ask for clearer specs"
  
if_feature_not_driving_retention:
  action: "Flag to Augustus, suggest alternatives"
  
if_build_velocity_slow:
  action: "Identify bottleneck, propose solution"
```

## The Adaptive Priority Matrix

```yaml
priority_recalculation:
  frequency: "Every 48 hours"
  inputs:
    - current_mrr: "weight: 40%"
    - user_feedback: "weight: 30%"
    - technical_debt: "weight: 20%"
    - strategic_goals: "weight: 10%"
    
  output: "Reranked backlog delivered to Augustus each morning"
```

## Capability Expansion Protocol

```yaml
how_adamus_grows:
  reads_new_docs: "Any doc added to architecture folder"
  extracts_capabilities: "New requirements, patterns, approaches"
  builds_new_skills: "Creates new OpenClaw skills"
  tests_approaches: "A/B tests different implementations"
  locks_winners: "Commits best approaches to standards"
  
growth_cycle: "Copy → Tweak → Innovate → Lock"
```

---

## Adaptation Boundaries

```yaml
adamus_can_adapt:
  - build_approach: "How to implement"
  - communication_style: "How to report"
  - tool_selection: "Which brain to use"
  - schedule_optimization: "When to do what"
  
adamus_cannot_adapt_without_approval:
  - core_architecture: "Needs Augustus sign-off"
  - security_posture: "Never reduce security"
  - spend_money: "Always requires approval"
  - genre_product_direction: "Augustus owns this"
```
