## The 33 Strategies (Genre-Applied)

### Group 1: Self-Directed Warfare (Strategies 1-5)
```yaml
1_declare_war_on_enemies:
  genre_apply: "Name the enemy: extractive platforms that steal creator IP"
  tactic: "Every piece of content contrasts Genre vs extraction"
  
2_do_not_fight_last_wars:
  genre_apply: "This is not a writing tool war — it's an ownership war"
  tactic: "Don't compete on features, compete on philosophy"
  
3_amidst_chaos_do_not_lose_your_head:
  genre_apply: "When AI chaos hits publishing, Genre = calm, owned infrastructure"
  tactic: "Position as the stable rail while everything else shifts"
  
4_create_a_sense_of_urgency:
  genre_apply: "AI is eating creator IP NOW — Genre protects it"
  tactic: "Every month without Genre = IP at risk"
  
5_avoid_the_snare_of_groupthink:
  genre_apply: "Don't follow what writing tools do — follow what creators need"
  tactic: "Talk to 10 creators before building any feature"
```

### Group 2: Organizational Warfare (Strategies 6-10)
```yaml
6_segment_forces:
  genre_apply: "Novelists vs Screenwriters vs Game Writers — different rails"
  tactic: "Build vertical-specific features, not generic ones"
  
7_transform_your_war_into_crusade:
  genre_apply: "This is a movement — Creator Sovereignty"
  tactic: "Every user is a member of the sovereignty movement"
  
8_court_attention_at_all_costs:
  genre_apply: "Be provocative about creator rights and AI theft"
  tactic: "Controversial takes that get shared, not ignored"
  
9_end_arguments_with_actions:
  genre_apply: "Don't argue about AI ethics — ship Lore and prove it"
  tactic: "Working product > manifesto"
  
10_create_compelling_spectacles:
  genre_apply: "Live demo of Lore catching IP theft = compelling"
  tactic: "Show, don't tell. Demo over deck."
```

### Group 3: Defensive Warfare (Strategies 11-15)
```yaml
11_trade_space_for_time:
  genre_apply: "Don't fight big platforms directly — build in niches first"
  tactic: "Own the contempl writer niche before scaling"
  
12_lose_battles_win_wars:
  genre_apply: "Lose the 'best AI writer' battle — win the 'creator ownership' war"
  tactic: "Let Sudowrite win on AI features, win on ownership"
  
13_know_your_enemy:
  genre_apply: "Deep analysis: Sudowrite, NovelCrafter, Notion AI"
  tactic: "Adamus Business AI monitors them daily"
  
14_overwhelm_resistance_with_speed:
  genre_apply: "Ship faster than any competitor using Adamus + OpenClaw"
  tactic: "10 features/week vs competitor 1 feature/month"

```

### Group 4: Offensive Warfare (Strategies 16-20)
```yaml
16_hit_them_where_it_hurts:

  tactic: "Identify top 100 writers on Sudowrite, recruit them"
  
17_defeat_them_in_detail:
  genre_apply: "Don't fight all competitors at once — eliminate one segment at a time"
  tactic: "Own fantasy writers first, then sci-fi, then romance"
  
18_expose_and_attack_soft_flanks:
  genre_apply: "Competitor weakness: they don't pay creators. Genre does."
  tactic: "Saga (payments) = direct attack on competitor weakness"
  
19_envelop_enemy:
  genre_apply: "Surround creators at every touchpoint: write, publish, monetize"
  tactic: "Full creator OS, not just a writing tool"
  
20_maneuver_into_weakness:
  genre_apply: "Big platforms are slow. Move fast in niches they ignore."
  tactic: "Build features for contemplative creators — too small for Notion to care"
```

### Group 5: Unconventional Warfare (Strategies 21-25)
```yaml
21_negotiate_while_advancing:

  tactic: "Every partnership conversation = market intelligence"

  genre_apply: "Know when to kill features, pivots, and strategies"
  tactic: "Adamus tracks feature ROI — kill what doesn't convert"
  
23_weave_fire_and_water:
  genre_apply: "Mix hard business (Saga payments) with soft community (Lore mythology)"
  tactic: "Neither pure SaaS nor pure community — both"
  
24_take_the_line_of_least_resistance:
  genre_apply: "Writers already want to protect IP — meet them there"
  tactic: "Don't convince — validate and amplify existing desire"
  
25_occupy_the_moral_high_ground:

  tactic: "Every competitor controversy = Genre opportunity"
```

  genre_apply: "Genre serves creators — not investors, not publishers"
  tactic: "Every decision framed as 'what's best for creators'"
  
28_give_enemies_enough_rope:
  genre_apply: "Let competitors over-invest in AI features while we own ownership"
  tactic: "Watch them burn cash on features creators don't want"

  genre_apply: "One creator type, one genre, one geography at a time"
  tactic: "Deep penetration beats wide shallow adoption"
