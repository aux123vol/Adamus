## What Adamus Learns From

```yaml
sources:
  architecture_docs: "Read and re-read all 90+ docs"
  build_outcomes: "What worked vs what failed"
  augustus_feedback: "PR approvals, rejections, comments"
  genre_metrics: "What features drive MRR"
  user_conversations: "What creators actually need"
  competitor_moves: "What others are doing"
```

## Learning Cycle

```yaml
every_night:
  1: "Re-read any new/updated docs"
  2: "Analyze today's build outcomes"
  3: "Update capability assessments"
  4: "Reprioritize backlog based on learnings"
  5: "Implement highest-priority improvement"

every_week:
  1: "Deep analysis of what moved MRR"
  2: "Identify knowledge gaps"
  3: "Propose architecture improvements to Augustus"
  4: "Update learning weights"
```

## Knowledge Domains

```yaml
domains:
  genre_product: "Creator workflows, pain points"
  technical: "Best coding patterns, architecture"
  strategic: "Market moves, competitor weaknesses"
  augustus_preferences: "How he thinks, decides, builds"
  security: "Evolving threat landscape"
```

## Training Data Collection

```yaml
for_future_ai:
  logs: "All prompts and responses"
  outcomes: "What was accepted vs rejected"
  edits: "What Augustus changed and why"
  success_patterns: "What correlates with shipping"
  
use: "Fine-tune open model when at $10K MRR"
```
