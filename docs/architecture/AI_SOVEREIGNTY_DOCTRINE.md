# AI Sovereignty Doctrine
## Genre's Path to Complete AI Independence

**Core Principle**: Never be dependent on any single AI provider. Build toward full sovereignty — your own models, your own infrastructure, your own data.

## The Sovereignty Ladder

```yaml
level_0_now:
  status: "API dependent"
  providers: "Anthropic (Claude)"
  cost: "$100-200/month"
  risk: "Provider can change terms, pricing, or shut down"

level_1_hybrid:
  status: "Hybrid (Claude + Ollama)"
  trigger: "$3K MRR"
  cost: "$50/month"
  risk: "Reduced — local models for most tasks"

level_2_mostly_local:
  status: "Mostly Ollama, some Claude"
  trigger: "$5K MRR (PMF)"
  cost: "$12/month"
  risk: "Low — Claude only for edge cases"

level_3_fine_tuned:
  status: "Fine-tuned open model on Genre data"
  trigger: "$10K MRR"
  cost: "Hardware only"
  risk: "Minimal — own the model weights"

level_4_sovereign:
  status: "Your own AI (OpenCode foundation)"
  trigger: "$50K MRR"
  cost: "Compute only"
  risk: "Zero vendor dependency"
```

## Adamus's Role in Sovereignty

```yaml
now:
  - "Collects all AI interaction data"
  - "Logs what works vs what fails"
  - "Identifies chokepoints"
  - "Trains on Genre-specific patterns"

later:
  - "Builds fine-tuning datasets"
  - "Tests open models continuously"
  - "Migrates tasks to local models"
  - "Eventually trains Genre's own model"
```

---

## Data Sovereignty

```yaml
what_we_own:
  - all_code: "GitHub — forever yours"
  - all_user_data: "On your infrastructure"
  - all_ai_logs: "Training data for future model"
  - all_creator_ip: "Lore system protects it"

what_we_dont_own_yet:
  - model_weights: "Working toward it"
  - compute_infrastructure: "At $50K MRR scale"
```

---

## Migration Triggers

```yaml
trigger_1_cost:
  when: "Claude API > 10% of MRR"
  action: "Migrate that task to Ollama"

trigger_2_capability:
  when: "Open model reaches 90% of Claude on Genre tasks"
  action: "Switch that category fully"

trigger_3_strategic:
  when: "Anthropic changes terms unfavorably"
  action: "Accelerate migration"
```

---

## The OpenCode Foundation

```yaml
why_opencode:
  - "Open source = you can modify"
  - "Foundation = build your model on top"
  - "Genre-trained = perfect for creator workflows"

timeline:
  year_1: "Use it, contribute to it"
  year_2: "Fine-tune on Genre data"
  year_3: "Genre's proprietary model"
```

**Status**: ACTIVE — Building toward sovereignty from Day 1
