# Meta Application Layers Summary
## AI Application Architecture for Genre and Adamus

**How AI layers stack from raw models to user-facing features**

---

## The Layer Model

```
Layer 5: USER EXPERIENCE
    Genre creators write, protect IP, get paid
    
Layer 4: PRODUCT FEATURES  
    MyGenre, Lore, Saga, World Bible
    
Layer 3: AI ORCHESTRATION (Adamus)
    Routes, coordinates, remembers, builds
    
Layer 2: AI MODELS (Brains)
    Claude, OpenClaw, Ollama, future models
    
Layer 1: INFRASTRUCTURE
    GitHub, SearxNG, Tailscale, SQLite
```

---

## Each Layer Explained

### Layer 1: Infrastructure
```yaml
purpose: "The foundation everything runs on"
components:
  github: "All code, all history"
  searxng: "Private intelligence"
  tailscale: "Secure remote access"
  sqlite: "Adamus memory"
  
philosophy: "Own it all, no SaaS dependencies for critical path"
```

### Layer 2: AI Models
```yaml
purpose: "The raw intelligence"
components:
  claude: "Best reasoning, complex tasks"
  openclaw: "Autonomous execution"
  ollama: "Free local inference"
  future: "Your own model"
  
philosophy: "Multiple models, zero lock-in"
```

### Layer 3: Orchestration (Adamus)
```yaml
purpose: "The intelligence layer that manages models"
components:
  coordinator: "Routes to right model"
  memory: "Never forgets"
  war_room: "Visibility"
  security: "8-layer protection"
  
philosophy: "Adamus is the mind, models are muscles"
```

### Layer 4: Product Features
```yaml
purpose: "What Genre users actually use"
components:
  mygenre: "AI writing partner"
  lore: "IP authentication"
  saga: "Creator payments"
  world_bible: "Story memory"
  
built_by: "Adamus"
philosophy: "Features serve creators, not platforms"
```

### Layer 5: User Experience
```yaml
purpose: "What creators actually feel"
components:
  sovereignty: "I own my work"
  payment: "I get paid fairly"
  memory: "AI remembers my world"
  protection: "No one can steal my IP"
  
north_star: "Creator sovereignty"
```

## How Adamus Serves All Layers

```yaml
layer_1: "Adamus manages its own infrastructure"
layer_2: "Adamus selects and uses models"
layer_3: "Adamus IS layer 3"
layer_4: "Adamus builds layer 4 (Genre features)"
layer_5: "Adamus optimizes for creator experience"
```

**Status**: ACTIVE — This is the mental model for all decisions
