# Changelog
## Adamus Architecture Evolution

---

## Version 1.0.0 — Week 0 Foundation (Current)

### Added
- Complete Networked AI Trinity architecture
- 8-layer security system (all frameworks)
- OpenClaw integration and security fixes
- Hybrid model strategy (Claude + Ollama)
- Corrected schedule (5pm-8am autonomous, 15 hours)
- Master context system (never forget)
- Complete artifact index (90+ documents)
- Go Lean Operating Protocol
- Augustus Coaching Framework

### Architecture Decisions
- **NO VPS** until $10K+ MRR (use laptop + Tailscale)
- **HYBRID AI**: Claude for speed, Ollama for sovereignty
- **OPENCLAW**: Primary autonomous brain (5pm-8am)
- **CLAUDE CODE**: Supervised brain (8am-5pm)
- **GITHUB FIRST**: Everything in version control

### Resolved Contradictions
- Schedule: Corrected to 8am-5pm work, 5pm-2am job
- Brain identity: Brains are tools, Adamus is orchestrator
- Document count: 90+ total (not 53 or 67)
- Cost: Standardized at $312-612/month hybrid phase
