  penalty: "Confusion, inconsistency"

3_github_first:
  rule: "Everything in Git. Always. No exceptions."
  penalty: "Lost work, no history, no collaboration"

4_tests_before_commit:
  rule: "If OpenClaw commits without tests, reject the PR"

  rule: "Any architectural change needs Augustus"
  penalty: "Uncontrolled system evolution"

6_security_non_negotiable:
  rule: "All 8 security systems active at all times"
  penalty: "Data breach, agent compromise"

7_schedule_respected:
  rule: "5pm-8am autonomous. 8am-5pm supervised."
  penalty: "Interference with Augustus's work"

8_creator_first:
  rule: "Every Genre feature: what's best for creators?"
  penalty: "Wrong product, no PMF"

## Operating Sequence

```yaml
every_morning_8am:
  1: "Review OpenClaw overnight work"
  2: "Merge approved PRs"
  3: "Set today's top 3 priorities"
  4: "Start building with Claude Code"

every_5pm:
  1: "Commit all work"
  2: "Set tonight's OpenClaw priorities"
  3: "Enable autonomous mode"
  4: "Leave"

every_night:
  1: "OpenClaw reads docs, implements from backlog"
  2: "Creates draft PRs"
  3: "Sends heartbeats every 2 hours"
  4: "Stops at 8am, generates summary"
```

## What Success Looks Like

```yaml
week_0: "Working Adamus v0.1 — all components running"
week_4: "Genre MVP shipping features via Adamus"
week_8: "Genre at $5K MRR, Adamus at 100+ capabilities"
week_12: "$10K MRR, PMF confirmed"
```
